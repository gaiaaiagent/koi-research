# RGP-15: Establishing Community Carbon Credit Standards

## Proposal Summary
This governance proposal seeks to establish standardized criteria for carbon credit verification within the Regen Network ecosystem.

## Background
The Regen Network community has identified the need for clear guidelines on carbon credit quality. Current practices vary widely across different projects.

## Proposed Changes
1. Implement mandatory third-party verification for all credits
2. Establish minimum monitoring periods of 5 years
3. Create a community review board for methodology approval

## Rationale
Standardization will increase trust in Regen Network credits and align with our core value of Re-Whole Value. This harmonizes agency across all stakeholders while nesting caring relationships between project developers and credit buyers.

## Implementation
Upon approval, these standards will be integrated into the network protocol through a coordinated governance act.

## Community Discussion
Several community members have raised important points:
- Alice: "This could increase costs for small farmers"
- Bob: "We need these standards to compete with traditional markets"
- Carol: "The monitoring period might be too long for some ecosystems"

## Vote
- FOR: Implement the proposed standards
- AGAINST: Maintain current flexible approach
- ABSTAIN: Need more information
