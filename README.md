# KOI Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (KOI) implementation for RegenAI, integrating BlockScience's KOI v3 protocol with Regen Network's metabolic ontology to create a distributed knowledge management system.

- Metabolic entity extraction from 1,100+ documents
- JSON-LD to TTL conversion pipeline
- Ontological research and unified taxonomy development

## ðŸ“– Master Documentation

ðŸŽ¯ **[KOI Master Implementation Guide](docs/KOI_MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - **PRIMARY REFERENCE**

**Complete consolidated guide** (Version 1.1) covering:
- KOI v3 protocol implementation with FULL/PARTIAL nodes
- Sensor, processor, and coordinator node architecture
- Entity resolution and deduplication strategies
- Complete end-to-end knowledge flow
- Integration with ElizaOS agents
- Next phase: KOI network implementation

- **[APACHE_JENA_INTEGRATION.md](docs/APACHE_JENA_INTEGRATION.md)** - Apache Jena Fuseki integration details
- **[ONTOLOGY-AS-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md](docs/ONTOLOGY-AS-KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH.md)** - Ontological innovation (consolidated)

- **[local-model-comparison.md](docs/local-model-comparison.md)** - Local model performance analysis

*Note: Individual documents preserved for reference, but Master Guide is the primary source of truth.*

## Key Recommendations

1. **Dual Identification System**: RIDs for semantic identity + CIDs for deduplication
2. **Transformation Provenance**: Track every operation with CAT receipts
3. **Apache Jena RDF Store**: Semantic reasoning with W3C standards compliance
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Standalone KOI Processor separate from agents
5. **Phased Implementation**: MVP in 2 weeks, full system in 12 weeks

## Implementation Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation (RID/CID, CAT receipts)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Processing Pipeline (modular stages, cost optimization)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Knowledge Graph (Apache Jena + RDF deployment)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Sensor Network (real-time monitoring)
- **Weeks 9-10**: Agent Integration (all 5 agents on KOI)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Registry Framework Integration (SPARQL endpoints, federation)
