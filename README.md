# KOI Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research on integrating KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) with the GAIA AI project to create a sophisticated distributed knowledge system for Regen Network.

## Main Document

ðŸ“š **[KOI_COMPLETE_RESEARCH.md](./KOI_COMPLETE_RESEARCH.md)** - Complete research, architecture, and implementation plan

This consolidated document includes:
- KOI infrastructure analysis
- Current GAIA system assessment  
- Proposed architecture with dual identification (RIDs + CIDs)
- Transformation provenance tracking (CATs)
- Technology recommendations (Apache Jena, RDF/SPARQL/OWL, etc.)
- Complete implementation code samples
- 12-week phased roadmap
- Cost optimization strategies
- Success metrics and KPIs

## Key Recommendations

1. **Dual Identification System**: RIDs for semantic identity + CIDs for deduplication
2. **Transformation Provenance**: Track every operation with CAT receipts
3. **Apache Jena RDF Store**: Semantic reasoning with W3C standards compliance
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Standalone KOI Processor separate from agents
5. **Phased Implementation**: MVP in 2 weeks, full system in 12 weeks

## Implementation Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation (RID/CID, CAT receipts)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Processing Pipeline (modular stages, cost optimization)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Knowledge Graph (Apache Jena + RDF deployment)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Sensor Network (real-time monitoring)
- **Weeks 9-10**: Agent Integration (all 5 agents on KOI)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Registry Framework Integration (SPARQL endpoints, federation)

## Quick Start

To begin implementation:

1. Review the complete research document
2. Set up KOI Processor Node (Week 1)
3. Implement dual identification system
4. Create transformation receipts
5. Test with one agent

## Current Status

âœ… **Research Complete** - Comprehensive KOI architecture designed
âœ… **Unified Ontology Deployed** - OWL-compliant metabolic + discourse ontology 
âœ… **Production Pipeline** - Processing 1,100+ documents with entity extraction
âœ… **Registry Framework Alignment** - Apache Jena + RDF/SPARQL/OWL integration
ðŸš€ **Ready for Semantic Web Deployment**

### Key Achievements
- **36-class unified ontology** with proper OWL inheritance
- **Ontologies as knowledge graph entities** with complete provenance
- **JSON-LD extraction** with essence alignment detection
- **CAT receipt system** for transformation tracking
- **Apache Jena integration strategy** aligned with Regen Network infrastructure

### Technical Stack
- **Apache Jena** + Fuseki SPARQL server for RDF storage and reasoning
- **OWL ontologies** for semantic modeling and automated inference
- **SPARQL endpoints** for Registry Framework integration
- **JSON-LD** for semantic web compatibility
- **Provenance tracking** with RID/CID dual identification
