# KOI Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research on integrating KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) with the GAIA AI project to create a sophisticated distributed knowledge system for Regen Network.

## Main Document

ðŸ“š **[KOI_COMPLETE_RESEARCH.md](./KOI_COMPLETE_RESEARCH.md)** - Complete research, architecture, and implementation plan

This consolidated document includes:
- KOI infrastructure analysis
- Current GAIA system assessment  
- Proposed architecture with dual identification (RIDs + CIDs)
- Transformation provenance tracking (CATs)
- Technology recommendations (Graphiti, Ollama, etc.)
- Complete implementation code samples
- 12-week phased roadmap
- Cost optimization strategies
- Success metrics and KPIs

## Key Recommendations

1. **Dual Identification System**: RIDs for semantic identity + CIDs for deduplication
2. **Transformation Provenance**: Track every operation with CAT receipts
3. **Graphiti Knowledge Graph**: Temporal tracking with Neo4j foundation
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Standalone KOI Processor separate from agents
5. **Phased Implementation**: MVP in 2 weeks, full system in 12 weeks

## Implementation Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation (RID/CID, CAT receipts)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Processing Pipeline (modular stages, cost optimization)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Knowledge Graph (Graphiti deployment)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Sensor Network (real-time monitoring)
- **Weeks 9-10**: Agent Integration (all 5 agents on KOI)
- **Weeks 11-12**: Commons Protocol (RDF export, federation)

## Quick Start

To begin implementation:

1. Review the complete research document
2. Set up KOI Processor Node (Week 1)
3. Implement dual identification system
4. Create transformation receipts
5. Test with one agent
